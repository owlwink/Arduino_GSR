# Arduino_GSR
This Arduino sketch provides a well documented program for use with GSR sensors. Many of the current approaches offer resistance values instead of conductance ones. I have included both options as well as a threshold based on average conductance values received. Conversion to micro-Siemens (the measurement unit for GSR) is also provided.
